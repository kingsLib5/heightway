        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Korea joined HSBC’s growing trade finance network in 1897. HSBC opened its business in Jemulpo (now Incheon) in August 1897. The bank offered current accounts to a diverse group of foreign merchants, traders and local entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The bank financed the thriving port’s traded goods – textile and tobacco imports and cotton and gold exports. In addition, HSBC participated in collective loans with other financial institutions to invest in modernizing infrastructure projects such as the Seoul-Busan railway, completed in 1905.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          HSBC had an uninterrupted presence in Korea until the Pacific War and continued its post Korean War presence through the Bank of Seoul, which became HSBC’s representative in the country. In October 1974, the Bank of Korea invited HSBC to establish its own office for trade finance in Seoul. HSBC’s business in Korea grew over the following decades.
